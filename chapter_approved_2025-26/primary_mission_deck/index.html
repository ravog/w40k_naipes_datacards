                In the Place Objective Markers step, players must
                set up one additional objective marker in No Man’s
                Land.
                Before setting up this new objective marker, players
                must first move the objective marker in the center of
                the battlefield 6” directly towards one of the corners
                of the battle field (if No Man’s Land touches any of
                the corners of the battlefield, you must move the
                objective marker towards one of those corners).
                Otherwise, the players roll-off, and the winner
                selects which corner the objective marker is moved
                towards. Players then set up the new objective
                marker 6” from the center of the battlefield towards
                the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to
                the previously moved objective marker.
